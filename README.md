# Tower of Babel

**Tower of Babel** is a real-time voice-to-text transcription and translation application. It leverages OpenAI's Whisper model for speech recognition and supports translation into multiple languages using the `deep-translator` library. The application also integrates with the ElevenLabs API for text-to-speech functionality, allowing users to generate and play back audio translations.

## Why "Tower of Babel"?

The name **Tower of Babel** is inspired by the biblical story in which humanity, speaking a single language, attempts to build a tower to reach the heavens. To prevent their success, God confuses their language, scattering them across the earth and creating a world of diverse languages.

This project embodies the spirit of overcoming language barriers. Just as the Tower of Babel represents the division of languages, this application seeks to bridge those divisions by enabling real-time transcription and translation across multiple languages. It aims to bring people closer together, despite linguistic differences, much like the original goal of the tower.
