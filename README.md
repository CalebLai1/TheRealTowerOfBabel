# Voice-to-Voice Translation Tool

This project is a voice-to-voice translation tool that transcribes recorded audio, translates it into selected languages, and generates audio for the translated text. It leverages OpenAI's Whisper model for transcription, Google Translate for translation, and ElevenLabs for text-to-speech (TTS). The user interface is built with Gradio, providing an intuitive way to upload, translate, and listen to audio in multiple languages.
